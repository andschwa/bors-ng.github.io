### Who's using bors?

This month's featured user is the [Mozilla Shield project](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Shield), maintainers of:

* [Normandy](https://github.com/mozilla/normandy), the "recipe server" for testing changes to Firefox on subsets of users
* [Delivery Console](https://github.com/mozilla/delivery-console), the web dashboard for resulting test metrics

Shield is the process Firefox follows for A/B testing, which can either be done with an add-on, or with a preference flip. Shield can then collect statistics, like error rates, user engagement metrics, and star ratings, to tell what kind of effect the change had.
